This repo harbors scripts, documentation, code and artifacts that aid the MMIX
backend for LLVM in some way:

- scripts:
-- to compile MMIX executables with a VERY basic init routine to at least get
   up and running
-- to run executables on an MMIX VM
-- to extract all MMIX patches from the downstream repo, and apply them
   to a clean LLVM, and run MMIX tests against all of them to see if they are
   still sane

- documentation:
-- rudimentary ABI document (todo)
-- notes.org
--- todo
--- overview description on general state of things (todo)
--- useful commands used to run and compile object files and tests
--- some general notes

- MMIX code:
-- Library: at the moment we only have the basics of the basics of a startup
   routine that sets up global registers and the stack. As bonus there's
   also an assembly routine that can write to stdout.

- artifacts:
-- some milestone binaries, kept in this repo because I'm a hoarder
